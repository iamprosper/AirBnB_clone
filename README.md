Welcome to the AirBnB clone project

  

## Description of the project

The AirBnB clone project is a simple copy of the AirBnB website. 
Our website will allow us to create and retrieve an object 
and also do operations on those objects and finally destroy them.

  

## Description of the command interpreter

The command interpreter is like the Shell but limited to a specific use-case.
In our case, we want to be able to manage the objects of our project:

	- Create a new object (ex: a new User or a new Place)

	- Retrieve an object from a file, a database etc…

	- Do operations on objects (count, compute stats, etc…)

	- Update attributes of an object

	- Destroy an object
